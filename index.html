                <h2>The story</h2>
                <p class="main-p"  class="good, bad">
                    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. 
                    They said, <blockquote class="quote">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</blockquote> The farmer said, <blockquote class="quote">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</blockquote>
                    The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <blockquote class="quote"><em>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</em></blockquote> The farmer again said, <blockquote class="quote"><em>Maybe</em>.”</blockquote>
                    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <blockquote class="quote"><em>“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</em></blockquote> and the farmer responded, <blockquote class="quote">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</blockquote>
                    The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <blockquote class="quote"><em>“Isn’t that great!”</em></blockquote> Again, he said, <blockquote class="quote">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</blockquote> 
                    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad 
                    — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune. <br>
